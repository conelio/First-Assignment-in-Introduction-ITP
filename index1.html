<title>My Profile-Universal Medical Clinical Software</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Project Idea</h1>
<p>My project idea is to develop a centralized clinical medical software for primary care physicians to enter patient clinical information and demographics and to be accessible by all authorized personal in Australia.  This software will be called Universal Medical Clinical Software. Currently there are about five clinical medical softwares dominated by two softwares: <a href="https://www.medicaldirector.com">Medical Director</a> and <a href="https://bpsoftware.net">Best Practice</a>
The other three are minor players. As of writting the current softwares do not have compulsory demographic captures such as capturing blood pressure, height and weight of patients. A patient can be seen by a primary physcian for years without blood their blood pressure being checked and not recorded.In addition identification of Indigenious people and other minority groups is not happening making it impossible to close the health gap between main stream and these disadvantaged groups. The current clinical data is not coherent and diagnosis are not properly coded making it difficult to collect data and apply preventative health and clinicians cannot share as the systems do not communicate with each and information is not being fed into the central My Health Records created by the federal government. My program will capture clinical and demorgraphic data and will be live across Australia and accessible anywhere by authorized clinicians.</p>

<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Interest in IT</h1>
<p>Information Technology has always fascinated me from the early days in high school but I have never had the opportunity to simply focus on it. I want to know the behind the scenes, how computers work and I am hoping to develop software that will change the world. I am in the process of learning information technology so that I can manage projects from concept to completion respecting deadlines at the same time.  I currently have no experience but I am a good team player with good communication skills and speak a few languages. What triggered me to study information technology was the cost of hiring some to develop my medical software, I was told it was going to cost me three million dollars but I can cut a lost of cost if I am part of the workforce, hence I decided to learn and RMIT was the best option for me after being recommended by my trusted friend of mine. I hope will come out a good programmer that I can write my medical software.</p>

<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Ideal Job</h1>
<p>The position of the Software Developer by <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39238720?searchrequesttoken=22be46b3-932e-4566-8773-8cf351d7393d&type=standard">eCreators</a> is my idea job. This job has duties  which include software development from scratch to completion involving team work and collaboration. It requires knowledge and experience in  PHP programming, LAMP/LEMP stack and good skills with  HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX. In addition knowledge integration and web design is a bonus. It is appealing to me because I will starting a project from scratch and see it through. I would love to work or create a company that will be able to develop software for life changing technologies. I would like to be the one who gets called whenever there is a development of significant software that is used in various departments and sectors from health, education and developing countries. It will take a lot of learning including up to masters’ degree as well as at least two to three years of work experience. It will need assembling a good teamwork around me. I am in the early stages as I am naïve to this industry but like anything, everything has a beginning and with focus and stamina I am certain I will achieve it.</p>

<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Summary</h1>
<p>Universal Medical Clinical Software is here to stay and it will revolutionize patient health care in Australia and focussing mainly on preventative health as patient data can easily be captured to improve clinical outcomes and reduce health costs. To develop such a software a programming language such as Java will be applied and connections with other organizations such as pathology, radiology and medicare will be networked and intergrated as well.</p>
